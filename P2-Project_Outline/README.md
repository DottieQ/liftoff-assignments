## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My application will provide a collaborative space to promote multi-vendor events. It’s purpose is to create a central location where event managers, vendors, location contacts and media contacts for pop up events (single to multi-day markets) can easily access other vendors’ contact information, social media accounts, photos, promotions, and hashtags. Users can create a social media post based on search criteria. After the login/account creation, search, and post generation features have been completed, a public and private calendar of upcoming and past events, and vendor message board will be created.

### Features
1. User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
2. Search: all users will be able to search predetermined categories (by the event coordinator).
3. Create Event: Users will be able to create new events when logged in and invite specific vendors to view event details. New events will appear in the user’s profile.
4. Create a Post: users will be able to use search criteria to combine social media tags, promotions, hash tags, photos, etc. to create text and gather photos for social media promotion.
5. Calendar: users can view a private calendar of their events. A public calendar of all events can be viewed without logging in/creating an account.
6. Message Board: users with an account can create posts on boards specific to each event. Boards will be private, only viewable by vendors that the event coordinator has invited to the event. 

### Technologies
Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, Hibernate, & Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
